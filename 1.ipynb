    "Anomaly detection is a technique used in data analysis and machine learning to identify patterns that deviate from normal behavior within a dataset. The purpose of anomaly detection is to detect unusual or unexpected patterns, outliers, or anomalies that do not conform to the expected behavior of the system or dataset. These anomalies could represent errors, fraud, unusual events, or valuable insights that warrant further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection algorithms aim to distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior by analyzing various features or characteristics of the data. It can be applied in various domains such as cybersecurity (detecting malicious activities), finance (detecting fraudulent transactions), manufacturing (identifying defective products), healthcare (spotting anomalies in patient data), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of anomaly detection is to enhance decision-making processes by highlighting unusual patterns that may require intervention, investigation, or corrective action."
