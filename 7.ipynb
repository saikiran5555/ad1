    "The Isolation Forest algorithm is a popular technique for anomaly detection that works by isolating anomalies in the data using random forests. Its key parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators: This parameter determines the number of trees in the forest. A higher number of trees can improve the performance of the algorithm but may increase computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_samples: It specifies the number of samples to draw from the dataset to train each tree. Larger values generally result in better performance but may lead to increased memory usage and slower training.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_features: This parameter controls the number of features to consider when splitting a node in the tree. It can be specified as an integer (the exact number of features to consider) or as a float (a percentage of total features).\n",
    "\n",
    "contamination: This parameter sets the proportion of outliers or anomalies expected in the dataset. It is used to define the threshold for identifying anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "bootstrap: A boolean parameter that indicates whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If set to True, each tree in the forest is built from a bootstrap sample of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "random_state: This parameter sets the random seed for reproducibility. By fixing the random state, you can ensure consistent results across multiple runs of the algorithm."
