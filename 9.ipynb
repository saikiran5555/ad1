    "In the Isolation Forest algorithm, the anomaly score for a data point is typically calculated based on its average path length compared to the average path length of the trees in the forest. The anomaly score is inversely proportional to the average path length, meaning that shorter average path lengths indicate a higher likelihood of being an anomaly.\n",
